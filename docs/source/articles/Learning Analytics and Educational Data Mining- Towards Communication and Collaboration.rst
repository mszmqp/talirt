Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining- Towards Communication and Collaboration
==================================================================================================


ABSTRACT
=======================================

Growing interest in data and analytics in education, teaching, and learning raises the priority for increased, high-quality research into the models, methods, technologies, and impact of analytics. Two research communities – Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) have developed separately to address this need. This paper argues for increased and formal communication and collaboration between these communities in order to share research, methods, and tools for data mining and analysis in the service of developing both LAK
and EDM fields.

对教育，教学和学习中的数据和分析越来越感兴趣，提高了对分析模型，方法，技术和影响的高质量研究的优先级。 两个研究社区 - 教育数据挖掘（EDM）和学习分析与知识（LAK）已分别开发以满足这一需求。 本文主张在这些社区之间进行更多和正式的沟通和协作，以便在开发LAK的过程中分享用于数据挖掘和分析的研究，方法和工具。
和EDM领域。

1. INTRODUCTION
=======================================

In education, the emergence of “big data” through new extensive educational media, combined with advances in computation [1] holds promise for improving learning processes in formal education, and beyond as well.
Increasingly, very large data sets are available from students’ interactions with educational software and online learning - among other sources - with public data repositories supporting researchers in obtaining this data [2].

在教育方面，通过新的广泛教育媒体，“大数据”的出现，加上计算的进步[1]，有望改善正规教育中的学习过程，以及其他方面。 学生与教育软件和在线学习（以及其他来源）的互动中，越来越多的数据集可以通过公共数据库支持研究人员获取这些数据[2]。

Two distinct research communities, Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK), have developed in response.
