We review the history and current trends in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM). We consider the methodological profile of research in the early years of EDM, compared to in 2008 and 2009, and discuss trends and shifts in the research conducted by this community. In particular, we discuss the increased emphasis on prediction, the emergence of work using existing models to make scientific discoveries (“discovery with models”), and the reduction in the frequency of relationship mining within the EDM community. We discuss two ways that researchers have attempted to categorize the diversity of research in educational data mining research, and review the types of research problems that these methods have been used to address. The most- cited papers in EDM between 1995 and 2005 are listed, and their influence on the EDM community (and beyond the EDM community) is discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION
=================================

The year 2009 finds the nascent research community of Educational Data Mining (EDM) growing and continuing to develop.
This summer, the second annual international conference on Educational Data Mining, EDM2009, was held in Cordoba, Spain, and plans are already underway for the third international conference to occur in June 2010 in Pittsburgh, USA. With the publication of this issue, the Educational Data Mining community now has its own journal, the Journal of Educational Data Mining. In addition, it is anticipated that in the next year, Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, Taylor and Francis Group will publish the first Handbook of Educational Data Mining.

2009年，教育数据挖掘（EDM）的新兴研究领域不断发展并不断发展。今年夏天，第二届年度教育数据挖掘国际会议EDM2009在西班牙科尔多瓦举行，计划已经在2010年6月在美国匹兹堡举行的第三次国际会议上进行。随着该问题的发布，教育数据挖掘社区现在拥有自己的期刊“教育数据挖掘期刊”。此外，预计明年，Chapman＆Hall / CRC Press，Taylor和Francis Group将出版第一本教育数据挖掘手册。

This moment in the educational data mining community’s history provides a unique opportunity to consider where we come from and where we are headed.

教育数据挖掘社区历史上的这一时刻提供了一个独特的机会来考虑我们来自哪里以及我们前进的方向。

In this article, we will review some of the major areas and trends in EDM, some of the most prominent articles in the field (both those published in specific EDM venues, and in other venues where top-quality EDM research can be found), and consider what the future may hold for our community.

在本文中，我们将回顾EDM的一些主要领域和趋势，该领域的一些最着名的文章（包括在特定EDM场所发布的文章，以及可以找到高质量EDM研究的其他场所），并考虑未来可能为我们的社区带来什么。

2. WHAT IS EDM?
=================================


The Educational Data Mining community website, www.educationaldatamining.org, defines educational data mining as follows: “Educational Data Mining is an emerging discipline, concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from educational settings, and using those methods to better understand students, and the settings which they learn in.”
Data mining, also called Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), is the field of discovering novel and potentially useful information from large amounts of data [Witten and Frank 1999]. It has been proposed that educational data mining methods are often different from standard data mining methods, due to the need to explicitly account for (and the opportunities to exploit) the multi-level hierarchy and non-independence in educational data [Baker in press]. For this reason, it is increasingly common to see the use of models drawn from the psychometrics literature in educational data mining publications [Barnes 2005; Desmarais and Pu 2005; Pavlik et al. 2008].


3. EDM METHODS
=================================
Educational data mining methods are drawn from a variety of literatures, including data mining and machine learning, psychometrics and other areas of statistics, information visualization, and computational modeling. Romero and Ventura [2007] categorize work in educational data mining into the following categories:

教育数据挖掘方法来自各种文献，包括数据挖掘和机器学习，心理测量学和其他统计领域，信息可视化和计算建模。 Romero和Ventura [2007]将教育数据挖掘工作分为以下几类：

* Statistics and visualization
* Web mining
    * Clustering, classification, and outlier detection(异常值检测)
    * Association rule mining and sequential pattern mining
    * Text mining

This viewpoint is focused on applications of educational data mining to web data, a perspective that accords with the history of the research area. To a large degree, educational data mining emerged from the analysis of logs of student-computer interaction. This is perhaps most clearly shown by the name of an early EDM workshop (according to the EDM community website, the third workshop in the history of the community – the workshop at AIED2005 on Usage Analysis in Learning Systems [Choquet et al. 2005]) .

这一观点主要关注教育数据挖掘在网络数据中的应用，这一观点符合研究领域的历史。 教育数据挖掘在很大程度上源于对学生 - 计算机交互日志的分析。 早期EDM研讨会的名称可能最清楚地表明了这一点（根据EDM社区网站，社区历史上的第三次研讨会 - AIED2005关于学习系统中使用分析的研讨会[Choquet et al.2005]）。

The methods listed by Romero and Ventura as web mining methods are quite prominent in EDM today, both in mining of web data and in mining other forms of educational data.

Romero和Ventura列为Web挖掘方法的方法在当今的EDM中非常突出，无论是在Web数据挖掘中还是在挖掘其他形式的教育数据方面。

A second viewpoint on educational data mining is given by Baker [in press], which classifies work in educational data mining as follows:

关于教育数据挖掘的第二种观点由Baker [印刷中]给出，它将教育数据挖掘中的工作分类如下：

* Prediction
    * Classification
    * Regression
    * Density estimation
* Clustering
* Relationship mining
    * Association rule mining
    * Correlation mining
    * Sequential pattern mining o Causal data mining
* Distillation of data for human judgment
* Discovery with models



The first three categories of Baker’s taxonomy of educational data mining methods would look familiar to most researchers in data mining (the first set of sub-categories are directly drawn from Moore’s categorization of data mining methods [Moore 2006]). The fourth category, though not necessarily universally seen as data mining, accords with Romero and Ventura’s category of statistics and visualization, and has had a prominent place both in published EDM research [Kay et al. 2006], and in theoretical discussions of educational data mining [Tanimoto 2007].



Baker的教育数据挖掘方法分类的前三类对于大多数数据挖掘研究人员来说都很熟悉（第一组子类别直接来自摩尔的数据挖掘方法分类[Moore 2006]）。第四类虽然不一定被普遍视为数据挖掘，但符合Romero和Ventura的统计和可视化类别，并且在已发表的EDM研究中占有突出地位[Kay et al。 2006]，以及教育数据挖掘的理论讨论[Tanimoto 2007]。

The fifth category of Baker’s EDM taxonomy is perhaps the most unusual category, from a classical data mining perspective. In discovery with models, a model of a phenomenon is developed through any process that can be validated in some fashion (most commonly, prediction or knowledge engineering), and this model is then used as a component in another analysis, such as prediction or relationship mining. Discovery with models has become an increasingly popular method in EDM research, supporting sophisticated analyses such as which learning material sub-categories of students will most benefit from [Beck and Mostow 2008], how different types of student behavior impact students’ learning in different ways [Cocea et al. 2009], and how variations in intelligent tutor design impact students’ behavior over time [Jeong and Biswas 2008].

从经典的数据挖掘角度来看，Baker的第五类EDM分类法可能是最不寻常的类别。在使用模型进行发现时，通过可以某种方式验证的任何过程（最常见的是预测或知识工程）开发现象模型，然后将该模型用作另一分析中的组件，例如预测或关系矿业。模型发现已经成为EDM研究中越来越受欢迎的方法，支持复杂的分析，例如学生的学习材料子类别将最有益于[Beck and Mostow 2008]，不同类型的学生行为如何以不同的方式影响学生的学习[Cocea等人。智能导师设计的变化如何影响学生的行为[Jeong和Biswas 2008]。


Historically, relationship mining methods of various types have been the most prominent category in EDM research. In Romero & Ventura’s survey of EDM research from 1995 to 2005, 60 papers were reported that utilized EDM methods to answer research questions of applied interest (according to a post-hoc analysis conducted for the current article). 26 of those papers (43%) involved relationship mining methods. 17 more papers (28%) involved prediction methods of various types. Other methods were less common. The full distribution of methods across papers is shown in Figure 1.

历史上，各种类型的关系挖掘方法一直是EDM研究中最突出的类别。在Romero＆Ventura对1995年至2005年EDM研究的调查中，有60篇论文报道了利用EDM方法回答应用兴趣的研究问题（根据对当前文章进行的事后分析）。其中26篇论文（43％）涉及关系挖掘方法。另有17篇论文（28％）涉及各种类型的预测方法。其他方法不太常见。论文中方法的完整分布如图1所示。




4. KEY APPLICATIONS OF EDM METHODS
===============================================
Educational Data Mining researchers study a variety of areas, including individual learning from educational software, computer supported collaborative learning, computer-adaptive testing (and testing more broadly), and the factors that are associated with student failure or non-retention in courses.

教育数据挖掘研究人员研究各个领域，包括教育软件的个人学习，计算机支持的协作学习，计算机适应性测试（以及更广泛的测试），以及与学生失败或课程中不保留相关的因素。

Across these domains, one key area of application has been in the improvement of student models. Student models represent information about a student’s characteristics or state, such as the student’s current knowledge, motivation, meta-cognition, and attitudes.

在这些领域中，一个关键的应用领域是改进学生模型。 学生模型代表学生的特征或状态的信息，例如学生的当前知识，动机，元认知和态度。

Modeling student individual differences in these areas enables software to respond to those individual differences,
significantly improving student learning [Corbett 2001].
Educational data mining methods have enable researchers to model a broader range of potentially relevant student attributes in real-time,
including higher-level constructs than were previously possible.
For instance, in recent years, researchers have used EDM methods to infer whether a student is gaming the system [Baker et al. 2004],
experiencing poor self-efficacy [McQuiggan et al. 2008], off-task [Baker 2007], or even if a student is bored or frustrated [D'Mello et al. 2008].
Researchers have also been able to extend student modeling even beyond educational software,
towards figuring out what factors are predictive of student failure or non-retention in college courses or in college altogether [Dekker et al. 2009;
Romero et al. 2008; Superby et al. 2006].

在这些领域中模仿学生个体差异使软件能够对这些个体差异作出反应，从而显着改善学生的学习[Corbett 2001 ]。
教育数据挖掘方法使研究人员能够实时模拟更广泛的潜在相关学生属性，包括比以前更高级别的结构。
例如，近年来，研究人员使用EDM方法来推断学生是否正在游戏系统[Baker et al。 2004年]，自我效能感差[McQuiggan et al。 2008年，离开任务[Baker 2007]，
或者即使学生感到厌倦或沮丧[D'Mello et al。 2008]。研究人员还能够将学生建模扩展到教育软件之外，以确定哪些因素可以预测学生在大学课程或大学课程中的失败或不保留[Dekker et al。 2009年;罗梅罗等人。 2008; Superby等。 2006年]。




A second key area of application of EDM methods has been in discovering or improving models of a domain’s knowledge structure. Through the combination of psychometric modeling frameworks with space-searching algorithms from the machine learning literature, a number of researchers have been able to develop automated approaches that can discover accurate domain structure models, directly from data. For instance, Barnes [2005] has developed algorithms which can automatically discover a Q- Matrix from data, and Desmarais & Pu [2005] and Pavlik et al [Pavlik et al. 2009; Pavlik, Cen, Wu and Koedinger 2008] have developed algorithms for finding partial order knowledge structure (POKS) models that explain the interrelationships of knowledge in a domain.

EDM方法的第二个关键应用领域是发现或改进领域知识结构的模型。通过将心理测量建模框架与机器学习文献中的空间搜索算法相结合，许多研究人员已经能够开发自动化方法，可以直接从数据中发现准确的域结构模型。例如，Barnes [2005]开发了可以从数据中自动发现Q-Matrix的算法，Desmarais＆Pu [2005]和Pavlik等[Pavlik等人。 2009年; Pavlik，Cen，Wu和Koedinger，2008]已经开发出用于寻找部分有序知识结构（POKS）模型的算法，该模型解释了域中知识的相互关系。




A third key area of application of EDM methods has been in studying pedagogical support
(both in learning software, and in other domains, such as collaborative learning behaviors),
towards discovering which types of pedagogical support are most effective,
either overall or for different groups of students or in different situations [Beck and Mostow 2008;
Pechenizkiy et al. 2008]. One popular method for studying pedagogical support is learning decomposition [Beck and Mostow 2008].
Learning decomposition fits exponential learning curves to performance data,
relating a student’s later success to the amount of each type of pedagogical support the student received up to that point.
The relative weights for each type of pedagogical support, in the best-fit model,
can be used to infer the relative effectiveness of each type of support for promoting learning.

EDM方法应用的第三个关键领域是研究教学支持（在学习软件和其他领域，如协作学习行为），以发现哪种类型的教学支持最有效，
无论是整体还是不同的群体学生或不同情况[Beck and Mostow 2008; Pechenizkiy等人。 2008]。
研究教学支持的一种流行方法是学习分解[Beck and Mostow 2008]。学习分解将指数学习曲线与绩效数据相吻合，
将学生之后的成功与学生收到的每种教学支持的数量联系起来。在最佳拟合模型中，每种类型的教学支持的相对权重可用于推断每种类型的支持对促进学习的相对有效性。


A fourth key area of application of EDM methods has been in looking for empirical evidence to refine and extend educational theories and well-known educational phenomena,
towards gaining deeper understanding of the key factors impacting learning, often with a view to design better learning systems.
For instance Gong, Rai and Heffernan [2009] investigated the impact of self-discipline on learning and found that,
hilst it correlated to higher incoming knowledge and fewer mistakes, the actual impact on learning was marginal.
Perera et al. [2009] used the Big 5 theory for teamwork as a driving theory to search for successful patterns of interaction within student teams.
Madhyastha and Tanimoto [2009] investigated the relationship between consistency and student performance with the aim to provide guidelines for scaffolding instruction, basing their work on prior theory on the implications of consistency in student behavior [Abelson 1968].


EDM方法的第四个关键应用领域是寻找经验证据来改进和扩展教育理论和众所周知的教育现象，以便更深入地了解影响学习的关键因素，通常是为了设计更好的学习系统。
例如，Gong，Rai和Heffernan [2009]调查了自律对学习的影响，发现虽然它与更高的知识和更少的错误相关，但对学习的实际影响是微不足道的。 Perera等人。
[2009]使用Big 5理论进行团队合作，作为一种驱动理论，在学生团队中寻找成功的互动模式。
Madhyastha和Tanimoto [2009]调查了一致性和学生表现之间的关系，旨在为脚手架教学提供指导，将他们的工作基于先前理论对学生行为一致性的影响[Abelson 1968]。


5. IMPORTANT TRENDS IN EDUCATIONAL DATA MINING RESEARCH
==========================================================

In this section, we consider how educational data mining has developed in recent years, and investigate what some of the major trends are in EDM research.
In order to investigate what the trends are, we analyze what researchers were studying previously, and what they are studying now,
towards understanding what is new and what attributes EDM research has had for some time.

在本节中，我们将考虑近年来教育数据挖掘的发展方向，并研究EDM研究中的一些主要趋势。
为了研究趋势是什么，我们分析了研究人员之前研究的内容，以及他们现在正在研究的内容，
了解什么是新的以及EDM研究在一段时间内具有的属性。



5.1 Prominent Papers From Early Years 早期著名论文
---------------------------------------------------------

One way to see where EDM has been is to look at which articles were the most influential in its early years. We have an excellent resource, in Romero and Ventura’s (2007) survey. This survey gives us a comprehensive list of papers, published between 1995 and 2005, which are seen as educational data mining by a prominent pair of authorities in EDM (beyond authoring several key papers in EDM, Romero and Ventura were conference chairs of EDM2009). To determine which articles were most influential, we use how many citations each paper received, a bibliometric or scientometric measure often used to indicate influence of papers, researchers, or institutions. As Bartneck and Hu [2009] have noted, Google Scholar, despite imperfections in its counting scheme, is the most comprehensive source for citations – particularly for the conferences which are essential for understanding Computer Science research.

了解EDM在哪里的一个方法是查看哪些文章在其早期最具影响力。我们在Romero和Ventura（2007）的调查中拥有优秀的资源。这项调查为我们提供了一份1995年至2005年期间发表的综合论文清单，这些论文被EDM中的一个主要权威机构视为教育数据挖掘（除了在EDM中发表几篇关键论文，Romero和Ventura都是EDM2009的会议主席）。为了确定哪些文章最具影响力，我们使用每篇论文收到的引文数量，通常用于表明论文，研究人员或机构影响的文献计量学或科学计量学指标。正如Bartneck和Hu [2009]所指出的那样，尽管计算方案存在不完善之处，谷歌学者仍然是最全面的引用来源 - 特别是对于理解计算机科学研究必不可少的会议。

The top 8 most cited applied papers in Romero and Ventura’s survey (as of September 9, 2009) are listed in Table 1. These articles have been highly influential, both on educational data mining researchers, and on related fields; as such, they exemplify many of the key trends in our research community.

罗梅罗和文图拉的调查（截至2009年9月9日）中引用率最高的8篇论文列于表1.这些文章对教育数据挖掘研究人员和相关领域都具有很高的影响力;因此，它们体现了我们研究界的许多关键趋势。

The most cited article, [Zaïane 2001], suggests an application for data mining, using it to study on-line courses. This article proposes and evangelizes EDM’s usefulness, and in this fashion was highly influential to the formation of our community.

引用最多的文章[Zaïane2001]提出了数据挖掘的应用，用它来研究在线课程。本文提出并传播了EDM的用处，并以这种方式对我们社区的形成产生了极大的影响。



The second and fourth most cited articles, [Zaïane 2002] and [Tang and McCalla 2005] center around how educational data mining methods (specifically association rules, and clustering to support collaborative filtering) can support the development of more sensitive and effective e-learning systems. As in his other paper in this list, Zaiane makes a detailed and influential proposal as to how educational data mining methods can make an impact on e-learning systems. Tang and McCalla report an instantiation of such a system, which integrates clustering and collaborative filtering to recommend content to students. The authors present a study conducted with simulated students; successful evaluation of the system with real students is presented in [Tang and McCalla 2004].

引用的第二和第四篇文章[Zaïane2002]和[Tang and McCalla 2005]围绕教育数据挖掘方法（特别是关联规则和支持协同过滤的聚类）如何支持更敏感和有效的电子学习的发展系统。正如在此列表中的其他论文中一样，Zaiane就教育数据挖掘方法如何对电子学习系统产生影响提出了详细而有影响力的建议。 Tang和McCalla报告了这种系统的实例化，该系统集成了聚类和协同过滤，以向学生推荐内容。作者提出了一个模拟学生的研究;在[Tang and McCalla 2004]中提出了对真实学生系统的成功评价。


The third most-cited article, [Baker, Corbett and Koedinger 2004] gives a case study on how educational data mining methods (specifically prediction methods) can be used to open new research areas, in this case the scientific study of gaming the system (attempting to succeed in an interactive learning environment by exploiting properties of the system rather than by learning the material). Though this topic had seen some prior interest (including [Aleven and Koedinger 2001; Schofield 1995; Tait et al. 1973]), publication and research into this topic exploded after it became clear that educational data mining now opened this topic to concrete, quantitative, and fine-grained analysis.

第三个被引用次数最多的文章[Baker，Corbett和Koedinger 2004]给出了一个案例研究，说明教育数据挖掘方法（特别是预测方法）如何用于开辟新的研究领域，在这种情况下是博弈系统的科学研究（通过利用系统的属性而不是通过学习材料来尝试在交互式学习环境中取得成功。虽然这个话题已经引起了一些先前的兴趣（包括[Aleven和Koedinger 2001; Schofield 1995; Tait等人1973]），但是在明确教育数据挖掘现在将这个主题打开到具体的，定量的后，这个主题的出版和研究爆炸了。 ，细粒度分析。


The fifth and sixth most cited articles, [Merceron and Yacef 2003] and [Romero et al. 2003], present tools that can be used to support educational data mining. This theme is carried forward in these groups’ later work [Merceron and Yacef 2005; Romero, Ventura, Espejo and Hervas 2008], and in EDM tools developed by other researchers [Donmez et al. 2005].

引用的第五和第六篇文章，[Merceron和Yacef 2003]和[Romero et al。 2003]，提供可用于支持教育数据挖掘的工具。这个主题在这些小组的后期工作中得以延续[Merceron和Yacef 2005; Romero，Ventura，Espejo和Hervas 2008]，以及其他研究人员开发的EDM工具[Donmez et al。 2005]。


The seventh most cited article [Beck and Woolf 2000] shows how educational data mining prediction methods can be used to develop student models.
They use a variety of variables to predict whether a student will make a correct answer.
This work has inspired a great deal of later educational data mining work – student modeling is a key theme in modern educational data mining,
and the paradigm of testing EDM models’ ability to predict future correctness – advocated strongly by Beck & Woolf – has become very common (eg [Beck 2007; Mavrikis 2008]) .

引用次数最多的文章[Beck and Woolf 2000]展示了教育数据挖掘预测方法如何用于开发学生模型。
他们使用各种变量来预测学生是否会做出正确答案。
这项工作激发了大量后期教育数据挖掘工作 - 学生建模是现代教育数据挖掘的一个关键主题，测试EDM模型预测未来正确性的能力范式 - 由Beck＆Woolf强烈倡导 - 已经变得非常常见的（例如[Beck 2007; Mavrikis 2008]）。

5.2 Shift In Paper Topics Over The Years 近年来论文方向的转变
-------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed earlier in this paper (see Figure 1), relationship mining methods of various types were the most prominent type of EDM research between 1995 and 2005. 43% of papers in those years involved relationship mining methods. Prediction was the second most prominent research area, with 28% of papers in those years involving prediction methods of various types. Human judgment/exploratory data analysis and clustering followed with (respectively) 17% and 15% of papers.

如本文前面所述（参见图1），各种类型的关系挖掘方法是1995年至2005年间最突出的EDM研究类型。这些年中43％的论文涉及关系挖掘方法。 预测是第二个最突出的研究领域，那些年来有28％的论文涉及各种类型的预测方法。 人类判断/探索性数据分析和聚类随后（分别）有17％和15％的论文。


A very different pattern is seen in the papers from the first two years of the Educational Data Mining conference [Baker et al. 2008; Barnes et al. 2009], as shown in Figure 2. Whereas relationship mining was dominant between 1995 and 2005, in 2008-2009 it slipped to fifth place, with only 9% of papers involving relationship mining. Prediction, which was in second place between 1995 and 2005, moved to the dominant position in 2008-2009, representing 42% of EDM2008 papers. Human judgment/exploratory data analysis and clustering remain in approximately the same position in 2008-2009 as 1995-2005, with (respectively) 12% and 15% of papers.

在教育数据挖掘会议的前两年的论文中可以看到一种截然不同的模式[Baker et al 2008;巴恩斯等人,2009]。
如图2所示，虽然关系挖掘在1995年至2005年间占主导地位，
但在2008 - 2009年，它下滑至第五位，只有9％的论文涉及关系挖掘。
预测在1995年至2005年间排名第二，在2008 - 2009年间占据了主导地位，占EDM2008论文的42％。
人类判断/探索性数据分析和聚类在2008-2009年与1995-2005年大致相同，分别占12％和15％的论文。

A new method, significantly more prominent in 2008-2009 than in earlier years, is discovery with models. Whereas no papers in Romero & Ventura’s survey involved discovery with models, by 2008-2009 it has become the second most common category of EDM research, representing 19% of papers.

一种新的方法，在2008 - 2009年比前几年显着更突出，是模型的发现。
虽然Romero＆Ventura的调查中没有任何论文涉及模型的发现，但到2008 - 2009年，它已成为第二大最常见的EDM研究类别，占19％的论文。

Another key trend is the increase in prominence of modeling frameworks from Item Response Theory, Bayes Nets, and Markov Decision Processes. These methods were rare at the very beginning of educational data mining, began to become more prominent around 2005 (appearing, for instance, in [Barnes 2005] and [Desmarais and Pu 2005]), and were found in 28% of the papers in EDM2008 and EDM2009. The increase in the commonality of these methods is likely a reflection of the integration of researchers from the psychometrics and student modeling communities into the EDM community.

另一个关键趋势是项目反应理论，贝叶斯网络和马尔可夫决策过程中建模框架的突出性增加。
这些方法在教育数据挖掘一开始就很少见，在2005年左右开始变得更加突出（例如，在[Barnes 2005]和[Desmarais and Pu 2005]中出现），
并且在28％的论文中被发现。 EDM2008和EDM2009。这些方法的共性增加可能反映了从心理测量学和学生建模社区到EDM社区的研究人员的整合。

It is worth noting that educational data mining publications in 2008 and 2009 are not limited solely to those appearing in the proceedings of the conference (though our analysis in this paper was restricted to those publications). One of the notable metrics of our community’s growth is that the proceedings of EDM2008 and EDM2009 alone accounted for approximately as many papers as were published in the first 10 years of the community’s existence (according to Romero & Ventura’s review). Hence, EDM appears to be growing in size rapidly, and the next major review of the field is likely to be a time- consuming process. However, we encourage future researchers to conduct such a survey. In general, it will be very interesting to see how the methodological trends exposed in Figures 1 and 2 develop in the next few years.

值得注意的是，2008年和2009年的教育数据挖掘出版物并不仅限于出现在会议记录中的出版物（尽管我们在本文中的分析仅限于这些出版物）。
我们社区发展的一个值得注意的指标是，仅EDM2008和EDM2009的程序所占的数量几乎与社区存在的前10年一样多（根据Romero＆Ventura的评论）。
因此，EDM似乎在迅速增长，并且该领域的下一次重大审查可能是一个耗时的过程。
但是，我们鼓励未来的研究人员进行此类调查。总的来说，看看图1和图2中暴露的方法学趋势在未来几年如何发展将是非常有趣的。



5.3 Emergence of public data and public data collection tools 公共数据和公共数据收集工具的出现
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


One interesting difference between the work in EDM2008 and EDM2009, and earlier educational data mining work, is where the educational data comes from. Between 1995 and 2005, data almost universally came from the research group conducting the analysis – that is to say, in order to do educational data mining research, a researcher first needed to collect their own educational data.

EDM2008和EDM2009的工作以及早期教育数据挖掘工作之间的一个有趣的区别是教育数据的来源。
1995年至2005年间，数据几乎普遍来自进行分析的研究小组 - 也就是说，为了进行教育数据挖掘研究，研究人员首先需要收集他们自己的教育数据。


This necessity appears to be disappearing in 2008, due to two developments. First, the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center has opened a public data repository, the PSLC DataShop [Koedinger et al. 2008], which makes substantial quantities of data from a variety of online learning environments available, for free, to any researcher worldwide. 14% of the papers published in EDM2008 and EDM2009 utilized data publicly available from the PSLC DataShop.

由于两项发展，这种必要性似乎在2008年消失。 首先，匹兹堡科学学习中心开设了一个公共数据库，PSLC DataShop [Koedinger et al。 2008]，
它可以免费向全球任何研究人员提供来自各种在线学习环境的大量数据。 在EDM2008和EDM2009中发表的论文中有14％使用了PSLC DataShop公开提供的数据。


Second, researchers are increasingly frequently instrumenting existing online course environments used by large numbers of students worldwide, such as Moodle and WebCAT. 12% of the papers in EDM2008 and EDM2009 utilized data coming from the instrumentation of existing online courses

其次，研究人员越来越频繁地使用全球大量学生使用的现有在线课程环境，例如Moodle和WebCAT。
EDM2008和EDM2009中12％的论文使用的数据来自现有在线课程的仪器。



Hence, around a quarter of the papers published at EDM2008 and EDM2009 involved data from these two readily available sources. If this trend continues, there will be significantly benefits for the educational data mining community. Among them, it will become significantly easier to externally validate an analysis. If a researcher does an analysis that produces results that seem artifactual or “too good to be true”, another researcher can download the data and check for themselves. A second benefit is that researchers will be more able to build on others’ past efforts.
As reasonably predictive models of domain structure and student moment-to-moment knowledge become available for public data sets, other researchers will be able to test new models of these phenomena in comparison to a strong baseline, or to develop new models of higher grain-size constructs that leverage these existing models. The result is a science of education that is more concrete, validated, and progressive than was previously possible.

因此，在EDM2008和EDM2009上发表的论文中约有四分之一涉及来自这两个现成来源的数据。
如果这种趋势继续下去，教育数据挖掘社区将会受益匪浅。其中，外部验证分析将变得更加容易。
如果研究人员进行的分析产生的结果似乎是人为的或“太好而不真实”，那么另一位研究人员可以下载数据并自行检查。
第二个好处是研究人员将更有能力建立其他人过去的努力。
随着领域结构和学生时刻知识的合理预测模型可用于公共数据集，其他研究人员将能够测试这些现象的新模型与强基线相比，
或开发更高粒度的新模型 - 利用这些现有模型的大小构造。结果是教育科学比以前更加具体，有效和渐进。


6. CONCLUSIONS
====================================


The publication of this first issue of the Journal of Educational Data Mining finds the field growing rapidly, but also in a period of transition. The advent of the EDM conference series has led to a significant increase in the volume of research published. In addition, public educational databases and tools for instrumenting online courses increase the accessibility of educational data to a wider pool of individuals, lowering the barriers to becoming an educational data mining researcher. Hence further growth can be expected.

第一期“教育数据挖掘期刊”的出版发现该领域发展迅速，但也处于转型期。
EDM会议系列的出现使得已发表的研究数量显着增加。
此外，公共教育数据库和用于在线课程设备的工具增加了教育数据对更广泛的个人群体的可访问性，降低了成为教育数据挖掘研究人员的障碍。 因此可以预期进一步增长。

It is possible that these trends will make educational data mining an increasingly international community as well. Between the papers in Romero & Ventura and the EDM2008 and EDM2009 proceedings, it can be seen that the EDM community remains focused in North America, Western Europe, and Australia/New Zealand, with relatively lower participation from other regions. However, the increasing accessibility of relevant and usable educational data has the potential to “lower the barriers” to entry for researchers in the rest of the world.

这些趋势有可能使教育数据挖掘成为一个日益国际化的社区。
在Romero＆Ventura的论文与EDM2008和EDM2009会议论文之间，
可以看出EDM社区仍然专注于北美，西欧和澳大利亚/新西兰，其他地区的参与度相对较低。
然而，相关和可用教育数据的可访问性越来越高，有可能“降低”世界其他地区研究人员进入的障碍。



Recent years have also seen major changes in the types of EDM methods that are used, with prediction and discovery with models increasing while relationship mining becomes rarer. It will be interesting to see how these trends shift in the years to come, and what new types of research will emerge from the increase in discovery with models, a method prominent in cognitive modeling and bioinformatics, but thus far rare in education research.

近年来，所使用的EDM方法的类型也发生了重大变化，模型的预测和发现越来越多，而关系挖掘变得越来越少。
有趣的是，看看这些趋势在未来几年如何变化，以及从模型发现的增加中出现的新类型研究，
这是一种在认知建模和生物信息学方面突出的方法，但在教育研究中却很少见。



At this point, educational data mining methods have had some level of impact on education and related interdisciplinary fields (such as artificial intelligence in education, intelligent tutoring systems, and user modeling). However, so far only a handful of articles have achieved more than 50 citations (as shown in Table 1), indicating that there is still considerable scope for an increase in educational data mining’s scientific influence. It is hoped that this journal will play a role in raising the profile of the educational data mining field and bringing to educational research the mathematical and scientific rigor that similar methods have previously brought to cognitive psychology and biology.


在这一点上，教育数据挖掘方法对教育和相关的跨学科领域（如教育中的人工智能，智能辅导系统和用户建模）产生了一定程度的影响。
然而，到目前为止，只有少数文章引用了50多个引文（如表1所示），表明教育数据挖掘的科学影响力仍有相当大的增加空间。
希望该期刊能够在提高教育数据挖掘领域的形象方面发挥作用，并为教育研究带来类似方法先前为认知心理学和生物学带来的数学和科学严谨性。
