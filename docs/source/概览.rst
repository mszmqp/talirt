The heuristic guiding the search is one of the two scoring functions for regression
models – AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information
Criterion) Each search is run twice, guided by a different heuristic each time. A good
model captures sufficient variation in the data but is not overly complicated by
balancing between model fit and complexity minimizing prediction risk [17]. AIC and
BIC are two estimators for prediction risk, and hence used as heuristics in the search.
AIC = -2*log-likelihood + 2*number of parameters. (3)
BIC = -2*log-likelihood + number of parameters * number of observations. (4)
where log-likelihood measures the fit, and the number of parameters, which is the
number of covariates in equation 2, measures the complexity. Based on these two
formulas, the lower the AIC or BIC, the better the balance between model fit and
complexity. BIC puts a more severe penalty for complexity, leading to a smaller
model than other methods.
A more interpretable metric for fit is Mean Absolute Deviance (MAD) -- the
average of the absolute values of the differences between observed values and
predicted values. We do not use it as a heuristic because it leads to over fitting. We
include it as a measure of the improvement in the model fit.
